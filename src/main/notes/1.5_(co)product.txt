Initial object
 - only one morphism / arrow to any object in category
 - unique in isomorphism
Terminal Object
 - only one morphism coming to it from any object in category
 - if b -> a: a more terminal than b
 - poset: partial order set
 - uniqueness of _ -> ()
Duality
 - C: category [reversing arrows] C-op : opposite category
 - Initial object -> Terminal object
 - reversing identity arrow: no-op
 - co-: reversing
   + co-product
   + co-monad
   + co-limit
   + co-cones
Isomorphisms
 - a -> b and b -> a: a, b is isomorphism: similar
 - isomorphism: invertible morphism
 - inverse of morphism
   + f . g = id
   + g . f = id
Products
 - Pair
 - product of 2 objects a, b is c.
 - c has 2 projections (p, q).
 - if there is c', there is a unique m: m . c = c'
 - m: factorizer
 - a, b in set -> (a, b)
Coproduct
 - Either
 - of 2 objects a, b
 - c has 2 injections
 - if there is c', c  (m)-> c'
 - coproduct is disjoint union
