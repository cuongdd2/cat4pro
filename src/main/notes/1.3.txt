Graph
 - Free category: each node is object, can connect to other node by adding more arrows
Order
 - preorder: a <= b, b <= c => a <= c. a <= a
 - partial order: a <= b, b <= a => a == b
 - linear/total order: any a, b => a <= b or b <= a
 - thin category: ordered set: any a, b, at-most 1 morphism (function) a -> b
 - hom-set: set of morphisms from a -> b: C(a, b) or Hom-C(a, b)
 - cycles: forbidden in partial order

Monoid
 - Associative
    + (a -> b) -> c = a -> (b -> c)
 - Unit / zero
    + zero -> a = a
    + a -> zero = a
 - Commutative: not monoid law
    + a -> b = b -> a
 - f(x) = value of f at point x
 - f _ = g _ => point-free equality
